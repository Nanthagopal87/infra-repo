Composer 2. GCS

Got it üëç thanks for sharing your **Terraform code**.
What you are seeing (only **Composer** + **GCS buckets**) is expected ‚Äî the other resources are **created *lazily*** once the environment gets to the ‚ÄúRUNNING‚Äù state.

Let me explain what‚Äôs happening in your case:

---

## üîπ What Terraform Manages Directly

* Enables **Composer API** (`google_project_service`)
* Creates your **custom Service Account**
* Binds `roles/composer.worker` to that SA
* Creates the **Composer environment resource** (`google_composer_environment`)

That‚Äôs why after `terraform apply`, you see only:

* Composer environment in the console
* 1 or more GCS buckets (DAGs, logs, data)

---

## üîπ What Composer Auto-Creates *afterwards*

When the Composer environment starts provisioning, **Google‚Äôs managed service** takes over and spins up resources **on your behalf** in the same project. These do not appear as Terraform resources, but they will exist in the project:

1. **GKE Autopilot Cluster**

   * Hosts Airflow components (scheduler, workers, triggerer, webserver)

2. **Cloud SQL (Postgres)**

   * Airflow metadata database (private IP if your env uses private IP)

3. **Cloud Memorystore (Redis)**

   * Task queue backend

4. **Pub/Sub topics/subscriptions**

   * For scheduling and internal ops

5. **Secret Manager entries**

   * DB credentials, Redis credentials

6. **Internal Load Balancers**

   * Airflow webserver, worker communication

7. **IAM bindings**

   * Between your custom SA and Kubernetes service accounts (via Workload Identity)

---

## üîπ Why You Don‚Äôt See Them Immediately

* Composer resource creation is **asynchronous**.
* After `terraform apply`, Terraform just requests Composer to create the environment.
* Composer takes **\~20‚Äì30 minutes** to fully provision all dependent resources (GKE, Cloud SQL, Redis, etc.).
* Until then, you‚Äôll see only **Composer + GCS buckets**.

---

‚úÖ **Check progress:**
You can run:

```bash
gcloud composer environments describe example-environment \
  --location <your-region>
```

and look at the `config.gkeCluster`, `config.databaseConfig`, `config.webServerIpv4Address`, etc.

You can also check in the **Cloud Console** ‚Üí **Composer ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Details tab**, you‚Äôll see linked **GKE cluster, Cloud SQL instance, Redis instance, Pub/Sub topics** once provisioning finishes.

---

üëâ Do you want me to give you a **list of `gcloud` commands** to enumerate *all the hidden resources Composer created* in your project, so you can audit them after Terraform runs?
