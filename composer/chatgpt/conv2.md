When i use the same TF code in my corporate env, where public repository access is denied, will i face any issues

That’s a **very good forward-looking question** 👌.

Yes, if you use the same **Terraform code** in your **corporate environment**, and your org blocks **public repository access** (like PyPI, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.), you may run into issues — but only in specific areas of **Composer environment lifecycle**.

---

## 🔹 What works fine (no external access needed)

* **Terraform resource creation** (`google_composer_environment`, SA, IAM, GCS bucket) → ✅ fine
* **Composer core control plane** (Airflow scheduler, DAG processor, webserver, workers) → ✅ fine
* **GCS DAG bucket** sync → ✅ fine
* **Cloud Logging/Monitoring integration** → ✅ fine

---

## 🔹 What may break (needs internet or public repos)

1. **Airflow PyPI packages**

   * By default, Composer allows installing Python packages from **PyPI (pypi.org)**.
   * In your corporate env, if PyPI is blocked, any `requirements.txt` installs will fail.

   ✅ Solution:

   * Host your own **Python package index** (e.g., on **Artifact Registry PyPI repo**)
   * Point Composer to it with:

     ```hcl
     software_config {
       pypi_packages = {
         "requests" = "2.31.0"
       }
       env_variables = {
         PIP_INDEX_URL = "https://<your-artifact-registry-repo-url>/simple"
       }
     }
     ```

---

2. **Docker images for Airflow workers**

   * Composer workers run on **Google-managed images** (pulled from `gcr.io` / `us-docker.pkg.dev`).
   * If your firewall blocks those registries, worker pods may fail to start.

   ✅ Solution:

   * Make sure **`gcr.io` and `us-docker.pkg.dev`** are allowlisted in your corporate firewall/proxy.
   * Or mirror required images to your **Artifact Registry** and configure Composer to pull from there (advanced setup).

---

3. **DAG dependencies / Custom plugins**

   * If DAGs/plugins import libraries from GitHub (e.g., `pip install git+https://github.com/...`), this will fail in a restricted env.

   ✅ Solution:

   * Vendor dependencies into your DAGs bucket.
   * Or pre-publish into your private **Artifact Registry PyPI repo**.

---

## 🔹 Extra note (Private IP + Shared VPC)

If your corporate env enforces **no external internet egress**, then Composer’s workers will **not reach out** to the public internet at all.
In that case:

* ✅ All GCP API calls (GCS, Pub/Sub, SQL, Redis) work fine over **Google Private Access**.
* ❌ Anything going outside GCP (PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub) will fail.

---

## ✅ TL;DR

* **Your TF code will still work** and Composer will deploy fine.
* But in **restricted corporate env**:

  * Public PyPI packages won’t install.
  * Workers must be able to pull images from Google Artifact Registry (`gcr.io`, `us-docker.pkg.dev`).
* **Fix**: mirror Python packages & Docker images into **Artifact Registry** and configure Composer to use those.

👉 Do you want me to draft a **Terraform example** showing how to configure Composer to install packages from a **private Artifact Registry PyPI repo** instead of PyPI.org?
