Perfect üëç let‚Äôs make your **Terraform code fully IaC-driven** by also creating the **Artifact Registry PyPI repo** inside Terraform.

Here‚Äôs the **updated complete Terraform config**:

## üîπ What this does

1. Enables **Composer API** + **Artifact Registry API**.
2. Creates **Artifact Registry PyPI repo** (`composer-pypi`).
3. Creates **Custom SA** + grants:

   * `roles/composer.worker`
   * `roles/artifactregistry.reader`
4. Deploys **Composer environment** that:

   * Installs `requests==2.31.0` from Artifact Registry.
   * Uses `PIP_INDEX_URL` to fetch packages only from private repo.

---

üëâ Next Step: you‚Äôll need to **upload your required Python wheels** to Artifact Registry before Composer can install them.

Would you like me to also add a **Terraform + Cloud Build job** to automatically upload wheels (e.g., `requests-2.31.0-py3-none-any.whl`) into your Artifact Registry repo? That way, package availability is also automated.
